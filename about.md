title: About Me
---

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am a Ph.D. Pre-Candidate in the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/appliedphysics">Applied Physics</a> department at the University of Michigan, advised by <a href="https://ners.engin.umich.edu/people/thomas-alec/">Dr. Alec Thomas</a>, and currently working on high-power laser interactions with plasma. I received my B.Sc. in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from Western Kentucky University in the Spring of 2024 and now live in the beautiful city of Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, us Physics graduate students do have lives outside of school. On that note, below is a collection of images that, in my opinion, accurately represent the life of the weirdly nerdy (but cool) person that is me!
