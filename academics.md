<p>This page contains all of the academic material covered during my graduate physics career.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer:</i> Note that these documents will inevitably contain some mistakes -- both typos and legitimate errors. Keep in mind that these are the notes of a graduate student in the process of learning the material herself, so take what you read with a grain of salt. If you find mistakes and feel like telling me, I would be grateful and happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of errors.</p>
